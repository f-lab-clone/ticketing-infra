## Introduction

Our primary goal was to build a scalable and efficient backend for a ticketing service that could handle high loads with minimal latency. The project focuses exclusively on the backend and infrastructure aspects, omitting a frontend interface to concentrate on the underlying mechanics and performance. This repository highlights the infrastructure conponents, illustrating our journey through building infrastructure, creating CI/CD pipelines, and managing containers. 

<b>Programming Language & Framework</b>: We chose <b>Kotlin</b> and <b>Spring Boot</b> for their expressive syntax and the powerful suite of tools for building web applications efficiently.

<b>Database</b>: We utilized <b>MySQL</b> for its powerful database locking functions, which are essential in managing concurrent operations effectively within our ticketing system. This capability ensures data integrity and consistent performance under high-load scenarios.

<b>Containerization & Orchestration</b>: <b>Kubernetes</b> was used to manage our containerized applications, enabling easy scaling and management across multiple servers hosted on AWS.

<b>Configuration Management</b>: <b>Helm charts</b> helped us streamline the installation and management of our Kubernetes applications.

<b>Continuous Deployment</b>: <b>ArgoCD</b> was employed to automate the deployment process, ensuring our changes were seamlessly and reliably pushed to production.

<b>Infrastructure as Code</b>: <b>Terraform</b> allowed us to define our infrastructure using configuration files, which helped in maintaining consistency and ease of deployment across environments.

<b>Performance Testing</b>: We employed <b>K6</b> to conduct spike tests, simulating scenarios with excessive simultaneous access to evaluate the performance and robustness of our system under extreme conditions. 

<b>Monitoring</b>: We integrated <b>Prometheus</b> and <b>Grafana</b> to monitor our applications and infrastructure, ensuring high availability and performance through real-time insights.
